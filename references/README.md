# PDF References Directory

This directory contains PDF documents that the chatbot can reference when answering questions.

## Adding New References

1. Place your PDF files directly in this directory
2. Files should be in PDF format
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `medical_guidelines_2024.pdf`)
4. The chatbot will automatically read and reference these documents during conversations

## How it Works

- The chatbot automatically reads all PDF files in this directory
- When answering questions, it includes relevant information from these documents
- The content of these PDFs becomes part of the context for each conversation

## Best Practices

- Keep PDF files relatively small for better performance
- Use clear, readable PDFs (avoid scanned documents if possible)
- Regularly update documents to maintain current information
- Back up your PDF files before making any changes
